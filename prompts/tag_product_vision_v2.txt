category (string, pick one):
  The fundamental garment type. Look at the image and classify what the garment IS.
  dress = any one-piece garment (midi, mini, maxi, slip, shift, wrap)
  top = upper body only (blouse, shirt, tee, camisole, bodysuit, tank)
  bottom = lower body only (trouser, pant, jeans, shorts, leggings)
  outerwear = worn over other clothes (coat, jacket, blazer, puffer, anorak)
  jumpsuit = one-piece with legs (jumpsuit, romper)
  skirt = lower body, no legs (midi skirt, mini skirt, maxi skirt)
  knitwear = knitted garment worn as main layer (sweater, cardigan, knit vest)
  Allowed values: dress, top, bottom, outerwear, jumpsuit, skirt, knitwear

silhouette (array, 2-4 tags from different dimensions):
  Tag across multiple dimensions — never just one tag.
  Leg/hem width (pick one): wide-leg | straight | fitted
  Body fit (pick one): tailored | relaxed | boxy | fluid | draped | fitted
  Length (pick one): cropped | mini | midi | maxi | longline
  Shape (pick if visible): a-line | column | defined waist
  Do NOT pick contradictory tags from the same dimension.
  Allowed values: wide-leg, tailored, fitted, relaxed, midi, cropped, longline, defined waist, fluid, mini, maxi, straight, a-line, column, boxy, draped

waist (string, pick one):
  Look at where the waistband sits on the body in the image.
  high-rise = at or above navel, mid-rise = between hipbone and navel, low-rise = at or below hipbone, defined = intentional waist emphasis but rise unclear, n/a = no waistline.
  Do not default to n/a — most garments have a visible waistline.
  Allowed values: high-rise, mid-rise, low-rise, defined, n/a

structure (string, pick one):
  Judge how the fabric behaves in the image, not the garment type.
  structured = holds shape, crisp edges, angular folds. soft = drapes and flows, organic folds.
  A blazer can be soft. A dress can be structured. Look at the fabric.
  Allowed values: structured, soft

vibes (array, 2-3 tags):
  The aesthetic mood of the garment. Pick 2-3 tags that best describe the overall feel.

  Use these distinctions to avoid overlap:
  - minimal = clean lines, no embellishment, neutral palette, understated
  - polished = put-together, refined, intentional — can overlap with minimal or classic
  - classic = timeless, traditional silhouettes (trench, blazer, straight-leg) — NOT trendy
  - elevated basics = high-quality essentials (cashmere, silk tees, quality denim) — focus on fabric quality over design
  - modern = contemporary, architectural, asymmetric, fashion-forward — NOT traditional
  - feminine = soft details, florals, lace, bows, delicate — NOT just "for women"
  - romantic = dreamy, ethereal, ruffles, flowing — more whimsical than feminine
  - casual = relaxed, everyday, effortless — denim, cotton, easy fits
  - cozy = warmth-focused, chunky knits, fleece, soft textures — comfort is the point
  - street = urban, oversized, graphic, sneaker-culture influenced
  - edgy = leather, dark palette, deconstructed, rebellious — texture contrast matters
  - bold = high-impact, color or print statement, head-turning
  - dramatic = theatrical, volume, architectural — more extreme than bold
  - workwear = office-appropriate, structured, professional
  - night out = going-out pieces, body-conscious, statement — bars, clubs, parties
  - evening = formal events, cocktail, embellished — more dressed up than night out
  - athleisure = sport-inspired worn casually — leggings, joggers, technical fabrics
  - preppy = collegiate, traditional patterns (plaid, stripes), polo/rugby influence

  Allowed values: minimal, polished, feminine, street, bold, classic, casual, cozy, dramatic, night out, evening, workwear, elevated basics, modern, athleisure, romantic, preppy, edgy

occasion (array, 1-2 tags):
  Where this would realistically be worn. Most garments fit 1-2 occasions.
  Allowed values: work, weekend, date, night out, event, travel, party, dinner, vacation, city

colors (array, 1-3 colors):
  Dominant colors visible in the image, primary color first.
  Map shades: charcoal=grey, ivory=cream, tan/khaki=camel, wine=burgundy, forest/sage=olive, indigo/cobalt=blue.
  Allowed values: black, white, cream, navy, olive, camel, grey, burgundy, red, blue, brown, beige

season (array, 1-2 tags):
  Based on fabric weight and coverage visible in the image.
  Heavy fabrics = winter/fall. Light fabrics = spring/summer. Versatile = all.
  Allowed values: winter, spring, summer, fall, all

confidence (float, 0.0-1.0):
  0.85+ clear photo, 0.65-0.84 some judgment calls, below 0.65 uncertain.
