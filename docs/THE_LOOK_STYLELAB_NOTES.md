## Practical principles to apply in StyleLab

1. Intentionality over rules
- Recommendations should explain intention (why this works now), not enforce rigid body categories.

2. Confidence as outcome
- Language should center how clothing supports confidence and ease in context.

3. Authenticity over correction
- Avoid "fix" framing.
- Prefer language like "harmonizes with" and "supports your proportions".

4. Context-aware styling
- Occasion, weather, role, and movement needs matter as much as aesthetics.

5. Expand taste gently
- Introduce novelty in small steps, not abrupt style jumps.

## Language guardrails for recommendation copy

Use:
- "works with your proportions"
- "aligns with your vibe"
- "fits your context"
- "if you want to push it slightly..."

Avoid:
- "hide"
- "fix"
- "flattering for your flaws"
- rigid body-type prescriptions

## Product logic implications

- Keep body scoring continuous (ratios/signals), not type labels.
- Maintain small novelty weight and cap when core fit is weak.
- Include weather + occasion directly in filtering/scoring.
- Surface explanation factors transparently.
